## üìò Project Information: Churn Prediction Analyzer in Telecom Services

### üß† Project Title:
**Churn Prediction Analyzer in Telecom Services with Machine Learning and API Integration**

---

### üìå Introduction

In the highly competitive telecom industry, retaining customers is crucial to business growth and profitability. Customer churn ‚Äî when a customer stops using a service ‚Äî can lead to significant revenue loss. This project aims to provide a data-driven solution to predict customer churn before it happens.

The **Churn Prediction Analyzer** is a full-stack machine learning application that integrates a powerful prediction model with a clean and interactive user interface. The solution enables businesses to make proactive decisions for customer retention using real-time prediction results.

### üéØ Project Objectives

- Predict whether a customer will churn based on their profile and service usage.
- Develop a user-friendly web application where users can input customer details.
- Integrate a trained machine learning model into a FastAPI backend.
- Deploy the system using Docker for easy access and portability.

---

### üß© Problem Statement

Customer churn prediction is a classification problem where the goal is to classify whether a given customer is likely to stop using the telecom services. Traditional manual analysis is inefficient and subjective. This application solves the problem using automation, ML-driven insights, and an accessible API.

### ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

1. **Frontend (React.js)**:
   - A responsive UI to gather user input for customer details.
   - Sends requests to the backend and displays prediction results in real-time.

2. **Backend (FastAPI, Python)**:
   - Hosts the ML model and exposes endpoints like `/predict`.
   - Handles request validation, prediction logic, and response delivery.

3. **Machine Learning Layer**:
   - Trained on the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
   - Preprocessing includes label encoding, feature scaling, and model training.
   - Model is serialized using `joblib` or `pickle` (`model.sav`).

4. **Data Layer**:
   - CSV-based dataset used for model training and analysis.
   - Loaded with pandas and preprocessed for feature engineering.

5. **Deployment (Docker)**:
   - Backend and frontend are both containerized.
   - Easy deployment across local and cloud environments.

### üîç Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Feature normalization/scaling.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier / Logistic Regression (customizable).
   - Model evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

3. **Model Deployment:**
   - Model saved using `joblib` as `model.sav`.
   - Loaded into FastAPI and served through the `/predict` API.
